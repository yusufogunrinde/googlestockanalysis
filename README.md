# Google Stock Analysis
The Google stock dataset was sourced from Kaggle, fields within the dataset includes the stock trade dates, opening and closing price, high, lows, trade volume 
and adjusted close. The dataset breakdown is presented in daily, weekly and monthly covering from 2014 - 2023.
Approaching this challange, I focused more on generating the weekly and monthly insight for a stock agency - "The Lavendar" which core interest is on sharing weekly stock news. To them the analysis can usher a broker to observing weekly trends, repeated monthly price pattern or further a diagnosis analysis on how the Google stock market has fared over the years. An undeniable hint is on how the Google stock trading volume has continued to witness a drastic reduction over the years. In theor blog the report is titled - "A sip from the Google Stock"
